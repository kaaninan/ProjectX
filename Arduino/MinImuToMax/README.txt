Hi
This is a little tutorial for interacting between the MinImu-9 v2 connected to an Arduino
Uno board and Autodesk 3DStudioMax in real time; and if you want to record this interaction and later
"clean" the noisy data of that animation with some tools from 3DSMax.
In the "3DSMax" Folder you will find some 3D scenes for 3DSMax 2013, 2012, 2011 or 2010
For the 2013 version you have to use the 2012 file.
Also There is a MaxScript in the "MaxScript" folder, so you can edit it or change or improve.
In the "MinImuToMaxArduino" Folder, you will find The Arduino program based in the Pololu´s one.
But you have to use this one, that have some changes in order to work with 3DSMax.
Finally there is a PDF tutorial which will guide you step by step to make the hole thing work.
You can watch a video of the program working in real time here:

Hope this could be useful for someone
cheers
